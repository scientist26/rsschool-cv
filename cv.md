## Summary
 I would like to become a high-performance developer. For this reason I have been learning JavaScript in RS School for 2 month. Before this I gained some basic skills in [HTML academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/). Every day I dedicate 5-8 hours to studies as my primary goal is to achieve necessary knowledge to start working as a software engineer as soon is possible.


## Skills
Studying the basics of:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

What is more, I have started to develop my first website using Visual Studio Code and Adobe Photoshop.


## Code examples

**Task**: you are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

**Solution**:
```sh
    function getMiddle(s) {
     if (s.length % 2 == 0) {
     return s[s.length / 2 - 1] + s[s.length / 2]
     }
      return s[(s.length - 1) / 2]
     }
```

## Education
